# üìò Documenta√ß√£o Viva - Arquitetura do Sistema

Este documento descreve a arquitetura atual do sistema utilizando **C4 Model** e **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)**.  
O objetivo √© manter a documenta√ß√£o atualizada e de f√°cil entendimento para todos os envolvidos.

## üß± ADR 0001: Use Hexagonal Architecture

**Context:** We want to design the system to be independent of specific frameworks, databases, and messaging tools. The core business logic should be separate from infrastructure concerns.

**Decision:** We'll use a **Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) architecture** for the Payment Service.

**Consequences:**
* **‚úÖ Pros:**
    * The domain logic remains independent of frameworks.
    * It's easier to replace external tools (like the database or message queue).
    * Improves testability by making it simpler to mock external dependencies via ports.
* **‚ùå Cons:**
    * Requires more boilerplate code compared to a traditional layered architecture.

## üßë‚Äçüíª ADR 0002: Use H2 Database for Local Development

**Context:** Developers need a lightweight, embedded database for local development and testing without the overhead of setting up and managing a full-fledged database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

**Decision:** We'll use an **H2 in-memory database** for all local development and integration tests.

**Consequences:**
* **‚úÖ Pros:**
    * Easy setup with no installation required.
    * Fast execution of integration tests.
    * The schema is automatically reset with each restart, providing a clean slate.
* **‚ùå Cons:**
    * Not identical to the production database, which can lead to minor differences in SQL dialect and behavior.

---

## üìÑ ADR 0003: Use RabbitMQ for Asynchronous Communication

**Context:** The system needs a reliable way for the **Payment Service** to communicate asynchronously with the **Notification Service** (a mock). We considered Kafka, but it's overkill for our initial scale.

**Decision:** We'll use **RabbitMQ** as the message broker for this asynchronous communication.

**Consequences:**
* **‚úÖ Pros:**
    * Easy integration with **Spring AMQP**.
    * Simple setup for development environments using **Docker**.
* **‚ùå Cons:**
    * Less suited for very high throughput compared to Kafka.

## üíæ ADR 0004: Use Redis for Caching

ts, the system needs to access rules for fees, interest, and country-specific information. Since these rules don't change frequently, accessing them directly from memory can avoid unnecessary REST calls to other microservices, improving overall performance.
**Decision:** We'll use **Redis** as the primary caching layer.

**Consequences:**
* **‚úÖ Pros:**
    * Provides very fast key-value storage.
    * Well supported by **Spring Data Redis**.
    * Can be leveraged for distributed locks and pub/sub in the future.
* **‚ùå Cons:**
    * Requires additional infrastructure to manage and maintain.

## üåê ADR 0005: Use BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) Pattern

**Context:** The frontend application needs a tailored API that exposes only the data it needs, without exposing the complexity of the backend domain. Directly exposing microservices would tightly couple the UI to backend logic.

**Decision:** We'll introduce a **BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) layer** that acts as an API gateway specifically for the frontend.

**Consequences:**
* **‚úÖ Pros:**
    * Enables tailored view models for the client.
    * Makes it easier to evolve the frontend without impacting the backend services.
    * Can provide fallback and security features before requests reach the core backend services.
* **‚ùå Cons:**
    * Adds an additional service that needs to be maintained.
